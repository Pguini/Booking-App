## Overview
This is a non-production academic project that I built to demonstrate application structure, state management, and client-server interaction using React Native. This app allows clients to select services, input details, book services, and submit feedback.

<b>Note</b>: This project is not deployed, and all backend endpoints are assumed to run locally (localhost), and no real user or company data is included.

<p/><b>Frontend: </b>React Native
<p/><b>Storage: </b>AsyncStorage
<p/><b>Backend: </b>LocalHost API
<p/><b>API Communications: </b>REST (JSON)

# Setup
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies (npm install)
4. Run the app (React Native CLI or Expo)
